# Project Description
Experimenting with various time series concepts and statistical/econometric models to solve business problems

## Learning Strategy
Code a little every day after work and do extended sessions during weekends.


# Key Components

## Modelling lagged relationships between 2 time series
1. Prewhitening two time series to eliminate common trend structures for cross-correlation calculation
2. ARDL, UECM, VECM modelling for known cointegrated economic relationships
3. Stepwise regression to identify leading indicators 

## Demand forecasting models
1. Benchmark different models using past forecasting competition data sets like the M6. (Bass Diffusion Model?)
